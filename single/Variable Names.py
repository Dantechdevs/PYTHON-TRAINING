#A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
#A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
#A variable name cannot start with a number
#A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
#Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

myvar = "John"
my_var = "John"
_my_var = "John"
myVar = "John"
MYVAR = "John"
myvar2 = "John"

myvar = "John"
my_var = "John"
myvar = "John"

#This example will produce an error in the result
#Mutiple variables

x = y = z = "Orange"

print(x)
